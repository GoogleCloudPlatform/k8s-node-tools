# Node Configuration in GKE

The below outlines a strategy for performing custom node configuration in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using init containers. The goal is to apply node-level settings (like sysctl adjustments, software installations, or kernel parameter checks) *before* regular application workloads are scheduled onto those nodes. To achieve this isolation temporarily, we'll mark nodes as unshcedulable with taint until configuration is completed.

## Supporting Tools for Node Configuration

A collection of tools, potentially packaged within a container image used by an init container, can help manage and configure various aspects of a Kubernetes node:

*   **Kubelet:** These tools can assist in managing and interacting with the Kubelet, the primary node agent in Kubernetes. This could include tools for:
    *   **Configuration management:**  Scripts or utilities to configure Kubelet settings.
    *   **Status monitoring:** Tools to check the health and status of the Kubelet service.
    *   **Log analysis:**  Scripts to collect and analyze Kubelet logs for debugging.
*   **Containerd:**  Tools related to containerd, the container runtime used by Kubelet to manage containers. This might include:
    *   **Container image management:** Tools for pulling, inspecting, or managing container images on nodes.
    *   **Container lifecycle management:** Utilities to interact with containerd for container creation, deletion, and status checks.
    *   **Snapshotter management:** Tools to manage containerd snapshotter for efficient storage.
*   **Sysctl:** Tools for managing and configuring sysctl parameters on Kubernetes nodes. Sysctl allows you to modify kernel parameters at runtime. These tools could help with:
    *   **Parameter modification:** Tools to apply specific sysctl settings to nodes, potentially for performance tuning or Node Specific node hardening required by your organization.
    *   **Configuration persistence:** Mechanisms to ensure sysctl settings are applied consistently across node reboots.
*   **Kernel:** Tools for interacting with or gathering information about the node's kernel. This might include:
    *   **Kernel module management:** Tools for loading, unloading, or checking the status of kernel modules.
    *   **Kernel parameter inspection:**  Utilities to examine kernel parameters beyond sysctl.
*   **Software Installations:** Tools to automate or simplify software installations on Kubernetes nodes. This could involve:
    *   **Package management:** Scripts to install packages using package managers like `apt` or `yum`.
    *   **Binary deployments:** Tools to deploy pre-compiled binaries to nodes.
    *   **Configuration management:**  Scripts to configure installed software.
*   **Troubleshooting Tooling:** A suite of tools to aid in diagnosing and resolving issues on Kubernetes nodes. This is likely to encompass:
    *   **Log collection and analysis:**  Tools to gather logs from various node components and facilitate analysis. to encompass:

### Part 1: Scheduling an Init Container for Node Modification

This example demonstrates how to use a DaemonSet with an init container to apply a `sysctl` configuration change to Kubernetes nodes upon pod startup. The DaemonSet will attempt to run on all available nodes.

#### Concept:

We deploy a DaemonSet ensuring one pod replica runs on each eligible node. This pod has an *init container* that runs first. The init container executes a command to modify a kernel parameter (`sysctl`) on the host node. Because modifying host kernel parameters requires high privileges, the init container runs in **`privileged`** mode and mounts the host's root filesystem. After the init container completes successfully, a minimal main container (`pause`) starts just to keep the pod running.

#### Example `sysctl-init-daemonset.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: sysctl-init-daemonset
  labels:
    app: sysctl-modifier
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sysctl-modifier
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sysctl-modifier
    spec:
      # Allow access to host PID namespace if needed for specific tools
      hostPID: true
      volumes:
      - name: host-root-fs
        hostPath:
          path: /
          type: Directory # Mount the node's root filesystem
      initContainers:
      - name: apply-sysctl-value
        image: gcr.io/gke-release/debian-base # Small image with shell tools
        # *** Requires privilege to modify host kernel settings ***
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
        volumeMounts:
        - name: host-root-fs
          mountPath: /host # Access the host filesystem at /host
          readOnly: false # Needs write access to modify sysctl typically
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
        - |
          echo "Attempting to set net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 on the host..."
          # Use chroot to execute the command in the host's root filesystem context
          if chroot /host sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1; then
            echo "Successfully set net.ipv4.ip_forward."
          else
            echo "Failed to set net.ipv4.ip_forward." >&2
            exit 1 # Fail the init container if command fails
          fi
          # Add other setup commands here if needed
      containers:
      - name: pause-container
        # Minimal container just to keep the Pod running after init succeeds
        image: us.gcr.io/gke-release/pause:latest
  updateStrategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
```

#### Walkthrough:

1.  **Save the YAML:** Save the content above as `sysctl-init-daemonset.yaml`.
2.  **Apply the DaemonSet:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f sysctl-init-daemonset.yaml
    ```
3.  **Verify Pod Creation:** Check that the DaemonSet pods are being created on your nodes:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -l app=sysctl-modifier -o wide
    ```
    * (Wait for pods to reach 'Running' state).*
4.  **Check Init Container Logs:** View the logs of the init container on one of the pods to see its output:
    ```bash
    # Get a pod name first from the command above
    POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=sysctl-modifier -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
    kubectl logs $POD_NAME -c apply-sysctl-value
    ```
    You should see the "Attempting..." and "Successfully set..." messages.
5.  **Verify on Node (Optional):** You can confirm the change by SSHing into a node where the pod ran and executing `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward`, or by running a privileged debug pod on that node.

### Part 2: Taint -> Configure with Init Container -> Untaint Workflow

This scenario demonstrates using taints to temporarily isolate a node (or nodes in a pool) for configuration via an init container, and then making the node available again for general workloads.

#### Concept:

1.  **Taint:** Apply a **`taint`** to a node pool. This prevents regular pods (without matching **`tolerations`**) from being scheduled there, effectively reserving it.
2.  **Configure:** Deploy a DaemonSet (like the one in Part 1) but add a **`tolerations`** block that specifically matches the taint applied. This ensures the configuration init container *only* runs on the isolated, tainted nodes.
3.  **Untaint:** Remove the taint from the indvidual nodes, allowing any workload (subject to other scheduling rules) to be scheduled on the now-configured nodes. The why: The source of truth of taints is at node pool level, meaning when the node pool scales up, or after upgrade, the new nodes always get the taint. This is the desired behavior, to prevent pod scheduling until config is done (and taint is removed).

#### Walkthrough:

1.  **Taint the Node Pool:**
    * Identify your target GKE node pool, cluster, and location (zone/region).
    * Apply a specific taint using `gcloud`. Let's use `node.config.status/stage=configuring:NoSchedule`.

        ```bash
        # Replace placeholders with your actual values
        GKE_CLUSTER="your-cluster-name"
        NODE_POOL="your-node-pool-name"
        GKE_ZONE="your-zone" # Or GKE_REGION="your-region"

        gcloud container node-pools update $NODE_POOL \
          --cluster=$GKE_CLUSTER \
          --node-taints=node.config.status/stage=configuring:NoSchedule \
          --zone=$GKE_ZONE # Or --region=$GKE_REGION
        ```
    * Verify the taint is applied to nodes in the pool:

        ```bash
        kubectl describe node <node-name-in-pool> | grep Taints
        ```

2.  **Run Init Container on Tainted Node:**
    * Create a DaemonSet YAML (`tainted-config-daemonset.yaml`). This is similar to Part 1, but **adds the `tolerations` block**:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: DaemonSet
        metadata:
          name: tainted-config-daemonset
          labels:
            app: tainted-configurator
        spec:
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: tainted-configurator
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: tainted-configurator
            spec:
              # *** Add toleration to match the taint ***
              tolerations:
              - key: "node.config.status/stage"
                operator: "Equal"
                value: "configuring"
                effect: "NoSchedule"
              volumes:
              - name: host-root-fs
                hostPath:
                  path: /
                  type: Directory
              # Allow access to host PID namespace if needed for specific tools
              hostPID: true    
              initContainers:
              - name: apply-config-on-tainted
                image: gcr.io/gke-release/debian-base # Small image with shell tools
                securityContext:
                  privileged: true # Still needs privilege for host changes
                volumeMounts:
                - name: host-root-fs
                  mountPath: /host
                command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
                args:
                - |
                  echo "Applying configuration on tainted node..."
                  # Example: Set a different sysctl value
                  chroot /host sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
                  echo "Configuration applied."
                  exit 0 # Ensure successful exit
              containers:
              - name: pause-container
                image: us.gcr.io/gke-release/pause:latest
        ```
    * Apply this DaemonSet:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f tainted-config-daemonset.yaml
        ```
    * Verify pods run *only* on the tainted nodes:

        ```bash
        kubectl get pods -l app=tainted-configurator -o wide
        ```
    * Check logs to confirm configuration:

        ```bash
        POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=tainted-configurator -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
        kubectl logs $POD_NAME -c apply-config-on-tainted
        ```

3.  **Remove the Taint:**
    * Once configuration is complete, remove the taint from the node pool to make it generally schedulable.
        ```bash
        # Use the --remove-node-taints flag with the exact key/effect pair
        gcloud container node-pools update $NODE_POOL \
          --cluster=$GKE_CLUSTER \
          --node-taints="" \
          --zone=$GKE_ZONE # Or --region=$GKE_REGION
        ```
    * Verify the taint is removed:
        ```bash
        kubectl describe node <node-name-in-pool> | grep Taints
        ```
        *(The specific taint should no longer be listed).*

    Now, regular deployments (without the specific `node.config.status/stage` toleration) can be scheduled onto the nodes in this pool again.

### Part 3: Privileged DaemonSet Tradeoffs and Security Restrictions

Using `securityContext: privileged: true` in a DaemonSet (or any pod) is powerful but comes with significant security implications. It essentially disables most container isolation boundaries for that pod.

#### The Tradeoff:

* **Benefit:** Grants the container capabilities necessary for deep host system interactions, such as:
    * Modifying kernel parameters (`sysctl`).
    * Loading/unloading kernel modules (`modprobe`).
    * Accessing host devices (`/dev/*`).
    * Modifying protected host filesystems.
    * Full network stack manipulation (beyond standard Kubernetes networking).
    * Running tools that require raw socket access or specific hardware interactions.
* **Cost:** Massively increased security risk and potential for node/cluster instability.

#### Security Restrictions and Risks:

* **Container Escape/Host Compromise:** A vulnerability within the privileged container's application or image can directly lead to root access on the host node. The attacker bypasses standard container defenses.
* **Violation of Least Privilege:** Privileged mode grants *all* capabilities, likely far more than needed for a specific task. This broad access increases the potential damage if the container is compromised.
* **Node Destabilization:** Accidental or malicious commands run within the privileged container (e.g., incorrect `sysctl` values, `rm -rf /host/boot`) can crash or corrupt the host node operating system.
* **Lateral Movement:** Compromising one node via a privileged DaemonSet gives an attacker a strong foothold to attack other nodes, the Kubernetes control plane, or connected systems.
* **Data Exposure:** Unrestricted access to the host filesystem (`/`) can expose sensitive data stored on the node, including credentials, keys, or data belonging to other pods (if accessible via host paths).
* **Increased Attack Surface:** Exposes more of the host kernel's system calls and features to potential exploits from within the container.

#### Best Practices / Mitigations:

* **Avoid If Possible:** The most secure approach is to avoid **`privileged: true`** entirely.
* **Use Linux Capabilities:** If elevated rights are needed, grant *specific* Linux capabilities (e.g., `NET_ADMIN`, `SYS_ADMIN`, `SYS_MODULE`) in the `securityContext.capabilities.add` field instead of full privilege. This follows the principle of least privilege.
* **Limit Scope:** Run privileged DaemonSets only on dedicated, possibly tainted, node pools to contain the potential blast radius.
* **Policy Enforcement:** Use GKE Policy Controller (or OPA Gatekeeper) to create policies that restrict, audit, or require justification for deploying privileged containers.
* **Image Scanning & Trust:** Use GKE Binary Authorization and rigorous image scanning to ensure only vetted, trusted container images are run with privilege.
* **Minimize Host Mounts:** Only mount the specific host paths needed, and use `readOnly: true` whenever possible. Avoid mounting the entire root filesystem (`/`) unless absolutely necessary.
* **Regular Audits:** Periodically review all workloads running with **`privileged: true`**.
