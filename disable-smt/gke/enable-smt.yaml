# Deploy this DaemonSet to enable hyper-threading on the nodes with the
# "cloud.google.com/gke-smt-disabled=false" label.
#
# WARNING: Enabling hyper-threading may make the node vulnerable to 
# Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS). Please ensure that this is acceptable
# before deploying this to your production clusters.
#
# WARNING: Enabling hyper-threading requires node reboot. Therefore, in order
# to avoid disrupting your workloads, it is recommended to create a new node
# pool with the "cloud.google.com/gke-smt-disabled=false" label in your cluster,
# deploy the DaemonSet to enable hyper-threading in that node pool, and then
# migrate your workloads to the new node pool.
